            Four weeks in, quarreling and far from home, we came to the loneliest place. 
            A western railroad town. Remember? I left you at the campsite with greasy pans
            and told our children not to follow me.
            The dying light had made me desperate.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have never been fishing on the Susquehanna
            or on any river for that matter
            to be perfectly honest.

            Not in July or any month
            have I had the pleasure—if it is a pleasure—
            of fishing on the Susquehanna.
